# Land Cover Change Detection Analysis and their Impacts on Land Surface Temperature in Denpasar, Bali, Indonesia

The rapid urbanization in Bali has brought incredible changes to the local area over the past few decades. Urbanization has driven local business development. It also affects land cover dynamics and land surface temperature (LST). This report analyzes Landsat satellite imagery from 1995 and 2015 of Denpasar city, Bali Province, Indonesia. This study summarizes and investigates changes of land cover types in twenty years and attempts to investigate their impact on LST.

By generalizing the observed relationships, it was found that they were basically consistent with the findings in the literature: (1) Built-up area has doubled in size, and the area of water body and vegetation area decreased from 1995 to 2015. (2) There was a negative correlation between NDVI and LST in 2015. However, changes of NDVI could only explain a small part of LST changes. (3) In Denpasar, the increase amount of built-up and bare area and the decrease amount of water body and vegetation area led to an increase of areas exposed in urban heat environment in the study period.

These findings will play an important guiding role in the future urban development planning of Denpasar city. By quantifying these impacts, it is possible to predict future LST changes in Denpasar so that appropriate measures can be taken to protect this most important hub in Bali.
